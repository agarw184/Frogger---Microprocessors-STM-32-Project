# Frogger project
Built the classic arcade game - ‘Frogger’. The objective of the game was to help our
character (the frog) cross the bottom of the screen to the top by dodging the obstacles (cars and
trucks represented by colored rectangular pixels) which ran across the screen horizontally at
different rates. The game started with the vehicles moving at the minimum pace. However, as
levels progressed, the speed of the vehicles increased which essentially made the game difficult
for the user.
